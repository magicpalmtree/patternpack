# Pattern Pack Documentation
PatternPack can do a lot for you.  The getting started guid is the best place to begin if you are new to the project.  Once you have an idea of what's going on the deeper documentation should become much more useful.  We are always trying to improve our docs, so please feel free to let us know, if you find any gaps or incorrect information.
