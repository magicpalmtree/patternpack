# Pattern Pack
PatternPack is designed to accelerate the creation of web application pattern libraries. When configured properly it will generate a static site pattern library.  The [patternpack-example-library](https://github.com/patternpack/patternpack-example-library) demonstrates exactly how to do this and is a good place to get started.
